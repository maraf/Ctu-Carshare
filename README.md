# CarShare

CarShare is a software project designed to connect people who travel between cities. 
It's purpose is that everybody, who owns a car or any other vehicle can offer his free seats in his vehicle publicly to other people, which will travel on the same route.
When anybody needs to travel somewhere, he can look up a registered user in our application which will go the same way in the same time. It will be even possible to communicate with other users, to negotiate the terms, departure time, etc.

A person who has no car or simply doesn't want to drive, can register a desired trip and will be alerted when someone else will register the same route as a driver. Then the driver will offer the time of departure, the price of the trip and other details of the trip.
It will be also possible to negotiate repeated travels (to school, to work, etc.) between drivers and non-drivers.

Everytime a person needs to plan a route, he will first search our database for coresponding routes and if he don't find anything, he can search for trains or buses as he would normally do.
The main benefits of this type of traveling in comparison with classic bus/train traveling is that the trip will be less expensive (for both the driver and the passengers), more comfortable and it helps protecting the environment. 
If you drive a car count the costs of the journey to work every day and divide them by four. This is the price that you would pay if the CarShare succesfuly finds someone in your region who travel the same route every morning.

Of course that not everybody will drive with a stranger. For this reason the application will have complex rating mechanism of registered drivers to help filter any inconvenient people. It may even happen that by using our application, you will make new friends, who share the passion for traveling.
At first, the application will be useful only for routes between bigger cities, but in the future, when the application grows, smaller and smaller towns and other places will appear in our database.

CarShare will be available worldwide. It won't be focused on any country. First two languages available will be Czech and English. 
The first version of this application will be available for Android mobile phones due to application's convenient alerting system, but we believe that in the future it will be available on other platforms.
